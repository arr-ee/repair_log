# Wavetek 1281 SN 35239

Came with leftmost Current Board connector unplugged on the DC side (`PL140`).

Internal corrections were ON out of the box.

CAL due 20.09.08

Power consumption after 1h+: 26,7W @ 242V @ 50Hz

- `TP405`: -7,18817
- `TP406`: -7,18377

"After" measurements are sus, bad probing

Disabling current board brought -35 rail to -35,9, but still not very stable

## Fast test failures

- ACI 2632
- DCI 2592

- DCI 2552

### Falures debug

2532-2592: DCI magnitude on 1mA-1A ranges

Curiously, 100uA is fine?

- `P212`: `FR +- 2%`
- `P214`: `0.1FR +- 2%`
- `P216`: `0.01FR +- 4%`
- `P218`: `FR +- 2%`
- `P220`: `FR +- 2%`

| Pathway      | Good meter | This meter          | Min acceptable | Max acceptable |
| :----------- | :--------- | :------------------ | :------------- | :------------- |
| P212 (1mA)   | +0,9925720 | +0,250 and dropping |                |                |
| P214 (10mA)  | +0,0991455 | -0,644 and dropping |                |                |
| P216 (100mA) | +0,0100010 | -0,738 and dropping |                |                |
| P218 (1A)    | +0,9900200 | +0,351 and dropping |                |                |
| P220 (100uA) | +0,9899000 | +0,9898500          |                |                |

100uA is the only range measured using 1k LoI Ohms range, rest are 100/100 LoI ranges — ?

All 2wire ohms ranges are borked, same for current besides 100uA; HOWEVER disabling the current board fixes them

Disabling current board also drops overall power consumption to 25.2W

Re-fitting top cover and running fast self-test suddenly fixed 100mV range?

### Internal source cal

After disconnecting the current board and allowing time for warmup, internal source cal ran until the very last test.

`Failure: 2912, HiOhm 1G range True Zero`

```
P058: 10V range, 10nA True Zero Ohms current, 100kOhm standard resistor
Magnitude: within 20ppm of FS == within 200uV?
```

Confusingly, same setup but with different current (100nA) is supposed to produce same values for P057/100MOhm

Furthermore, `P055` — 10MOhm True Zero — has the same setup as P058, but has its magnitude spec'd as "within 250Ohm" — ???

`P054` is also a True Zero path, and it's spec'd in ppm(FS), which makes sense. (From `Table 5.2.3.1` it should be on 100mV range?)

Does True Zero mean there is no current flowing through the resistors (since sink is off?) Should I check RL104?

Might also be due to leakages somewhere? We're hunting ~4nA (or ~2nA if it's actually FR)

Notes:

- 0V(8) == Mecca == ADC low input
- 0V(2) == ground used for true zero instead of current sink == Ohms board analogue ground?

### Current board checks

UA741 has been replaced by OP07 on newer boards

- Q101 appears to have been reworked/replaced
- RL102/RL103 (actually all others too) appear to have 100-110 Ohm from 4/13 to (open) 8/9
- RL102 appears to be fine
  - out of circuit it's fine
  - 4-8 and 13-9 have 110 Ohm with all relays removed
- RL103 appears to be fine
  - out of circuit it's fine, need to check how it's powered
  - 4-8 and 13-9 have 110 Ohm with all relays removed
- RL104, S3-DC24:
  - 2-3 closed (expected), 4-5 closed (not expected), 10-11 & 8-9 have 110 ohms between as rest
  - relay refused to switch at first
  - when energised, all contacts are open
  - out of circuit relays is fine
  - 10-11 and 8-9 have 111 ohms with all relays removed
- RL101, S2-DC24:
  - 2-3 & 8-9 closed, 4-5 & 10-11 open as expected; 10-11 appear to have 8.5M across instead of OL
  - out of circuit relay is fine
  - with all relays out, 2-3 on pcb has 2.5Mohm between, but not super stable; 10-11 has 17M one way and 7.2M the other
- RL100, S3-DC24:
  - 2-3 & 8-9 open, 4-5 & 10-11 closed
  - out of circuit, 8-9 does not open, rest seems fine but click is rather quiet

- R111 was measuring 55 Ohms in circuit instead of 900; removing it confirmed that it's ok, resistance for RL103 dropped to 101 Ohms
- Removing (previously repaired by somebody) Q101 changed resistance for RL104 to 4.5M one way and 3.6M the other
- At this point, pins 4 & 13 of R102/R103 have 12-15 Ohm with capacitor-like ramp to one leg of (removed) R111, O/S to the other.
- Q206 appears to be shorted

At this point, Q101 and RL100 are to be replaced. Parts of the H-bridges driving relays most certainly will need to be replaced due to my carelessness testing relays in-circuit.

Somehow I missed a topic on EEVBlog describing virtually identical behaviour on Datron 1271: <https://www.eevblog.com/forum/repair/datron-1271-meter-repair-help/>

`Q101` being identified as a culprit there, and its being questionable in my case, suggests I might have been causing more harm than good with further interventions. Still, identifying a faulty relay might help, so let's see if things improve once I reassemble the board.

I shall also compare test point values on "good" and "bad" boards, as well as current draw and temperature snapshots — board in question has been drawing about 1W and had some warm spots.
