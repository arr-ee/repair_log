## Status 18/07/2023

- In- and out-guard supplies recapped (one axial cap left)
- Out-guard: Q3 & Q4 replaced (one dead, one preventively)
- In-guard: Q1 replaced since that supply was not regulating, and it was measuring off by the tester, most heatsunk devices repasted. C1 & C2 were shorted.
- Power amp: recapped completely except for 2.2/3.3uF tants. ALL capacitors were fine! Unbelievable.
- DC board: RL14 was desoldered and exercised with ~100mA current to little effect. After tracing signals, `OFF` was being pulled low (well, high, to -0.3V from -14.5V), solved by replacing M5 (MC14025)
- Seems to power up from cold without issues
- All outputs work, voltage has ~25mV/V offset on 10V range, scaled to other ranges accordingly
- Main voltages appear ok-ish with the exception of +-35V(2), but that might be fine?
- Board voltages not checked
- Refdiv board _hot_ in switching section, which appears to be not unusual but still concerning
  - See falstadt model, apparently switch drivers are supposed to be this hot. Oh well.
- Stability not checked

## Status 22/07/2023

- Fully assembled
- `Fail 7` on startup that disappears in several seconds; selftest passes — interesting.
- Logging 10V with K2002, 3 hours in: somewhat odd behaviour with output rising ~200uV over first ~1.5h, then dropping, but much slower: 15ish uV over 1.5h.
- Output never stopped dropping, see [screenshot](photos/sn8550/10V_out_1.png). 10V buffer (TP5-TP16 DC board) also appears to have been dropping, see [screenshot](photos/sn8850/10V_buffer.png)

## Status 24/07/2023

- Cleaned and mostly recapped the refdiv board. Caps were mostly fine, although 470uF elco had high dissipation factor. Cleaning out silicone from the bodge required desoldering, and bodge components were replaced.
- Powerup brought new issues, with Error 6 popping up multiple times from cold. Battery is at 3.7V. This is going to be fun to track down.
- Output behaviour [changed somewhat](photos/sn8850/10V_out_2.png): ramp up is almost 200uV, ramp down is ~1ppm/h straight away.
- Attempted cleanup of the DC board, mostly around `Q11`/`M19` bodge (bodge redone), so far doesn't look like it changed anything. Next up:
  - log overnight
  - re-check voltage rails
  - check direct reference output
  - check HI/LO(DC REF) signals

## Status 25/07/2023

- Another change [in output behaviour](photos/sn8850/10V_out_3.png): now, it went down ~5ppm from peak and floats within ~1.5ppm window. Better, but still very bad.

## Status 26/07/2023

- vref graphs go here. notes:
  - Measuring off 0V(4) testpoint might not be the best, should re-measure off pin A on vref module.
  - Fully settled output graph from above looks similar to vref graph so maybe there's little/no issues on the path, but checking flip-flops might be a good idea still.
  - Not sure if actual issue but current data capture setup is shit actually and only gets every 8th reading, with triggering controlled by the meter.

## 4000 vs 4000a

According to the manual, there are three differences:

1. **4.6.4.1**: Reference board is different and contains a potentiometer to set TC slope of M2 (explain how?)
2. **4.7.8.1**: 1V and 100mV attenuators have resistors changed to single part voltage dividers; 1V has 90K/10K (`R74`), 100mV got 1K/111.11R (`R75`).
3. **4.8.10.1**: 100V/1000V attenuator has `R10`, `R27`, `R46`, and `R48` (1.25MOhm each) replaced with five 1M parts; additionally, `R89`, `R96`, and `R99` become a single 900K/100K divider.

I have not found details on non-A resistors in the manual, and schematics appear to only show the A version.

## Unit-specific notes

According to datecodes on various chips, this unit has been built around Q2 1983. Model 4000 was released around second half of 1982 at the earliest (I think, given that e.g. interconnection diagram's issue 1 was on May 25, 1982, front & digital PCBs' issue 1 was in May 1982 as well, and DC board was released on June 25, 1982)

Most serial numbers on parts are under 100, with one of the power supplies being number 34, and `400457 MF Transformer Assy` marked as 15. This, as well as board issue numbers, hints at the unit being a rather early one.

Instument appears to have been serviced in 1996 and 1998:

- Front PCB
  - Right-hand display only had two pins soldered, and double-sided tape was not attached. Resoldering it revealed that it works, but has dimming segments.
  - ???
- Digital board
  - Appears untouched besides battery, which has Aug 1998 datecode.
  - Firmware is `8A`, March 14, 1983, except for `M21`, which has the same revision, but April 6, 1983 date.
- Analogue interface board
  - Untouched
- Reference divider board
  - `M2`-`M9` optocouplers (with the exception of green dot-selected `M4`) have been replaced, 1998 datecode.
  - `M15`, `M19`, `M25`, `M27`, `M30`, `M31` (MC14094, 8-stage shift register), and `M18`, `M22` (MC14021, also shift register) have been replaced, 1997 date code on all parts. This bunch is responsible for most digital signals coming out of the board, which is a good portion of digital signals in the instrument.
  - `Q44` has 1990 datecode and is a `U404`, just as suggested in the [UK Vintage Radio thread](https://www.vintage-radio.net/forum/showthread.php?p=1551824) I found. 4708 also has `U404` in these spots.
  - Couple of flux spots on the back, but nothing major.
- DC board
  - All relays on the DC board replaced on Feb 6, 1996, according to the label on the board.
  - DC board was upgraded to 4000A spec, with one difference: `R74` is identical to `R75`, 1K/111.11R instead of 90K/10K. Ratio is the same, but maybe this increases current flow through the resistor? Although it looks like it'd lead to 90mW dissipated in the resistor worst case, which should be fine? Idk.

    Resistor datecodes indicate 1998.
  - `M16` and `M20` have a 1990 datecode, suggesting they've been swapped at some point.
  - `Q6` and `Q11` have a 1990 datecode and are `U404`.
  - There is a bunch of flux residue and signs of rework on the back of the board, with gorgeous joints on `Q3` in particular **PHOTO?**
- Power amplifier board
  - A lot of signs of repair on the back; `Q17` and `Q22`-`Q24` have pads destroyed, bunch of other reworked spots and flux residue.
  - `R147` & `R148` from board issue 6 have been added.
- Power supply boards appear to have not been touched.

## TODO

- Ref board revisions: Q38/39 delete
- Amp board revisions: rev 5-7
- DC board revisions: rev10 replaces ICL7650SCPD with LTC1052CN
- Recap rest of boards, possibly replace power transistors & regulators
