# Datron 4708 S/N 22916-4

## Initial condition

- Options 10 (DC), 20 (AC), 30 (I & Ohms), so fully packed.
- Front panel in great condition, both displays and all keys work. One odd thing noticed is that during self-test, many lower segments of the left-hand display are off when "RUNNING" is displayed. In other cases, they work just fine. Odd.
- No errors on power up, `FAIL 2` (overvoltage) during self-test.
- `FAIL 8` when trying to enable current mode.

According to seller, meter was not accepting calibration, lower DCV ranges had an offset, ACV was not working above 100mV, "other ranges need adjustment".

### Smoke checks

- DCV: works all the way to +-1000V; ranges under 1V show ~3uV offset at full scale. Given that everything under 1V is generated from 1V range with static attenuators, this might be a calibration issue.
- ACV: works below 1V, higher ranges were showing ~0.7V regardless. Additionally, 100Hz range was not working, resulting in same ~0.7V output.
- Ohms: works, 4W values were mostly in tolerance.
- Current: `FAIL 8`.

## Power supply check 1

Power consumption at plug: 0.66A @ 240V idle / 10DCV set, 1.6A @ 240V with 100DCV set. That's within 400VA spec, but quite a bit higher than ~0.4A model 4000 consumes. Different PSU architecture might explain some of the increase, but worth keeping an eye on this as we go.

## Board checks

- Out-guard PSU
  - Q4 was very hot — PCB discolored. Tests a bit off too.
  - All elcos and tants measure dissipation factor around 0.2
- In-guard PSU
  - C16 blown
  - Most elcos measure fine, some tants measure high D
- 38V PSU
  - C6 and C9 measure high both in capacitance and dissipation factor, others seem fine.
- Power amp
  - C51 and C54 measure out of spec on capacitance and D > 3. C26 measures in nF instead of 100uF.
  - C50 looks discolored and measures 1.4uF instead of 100pF (schematic error?)
  - Couple of flux spots, but likely to be factory.
- DC PCB
  - One of the ejectors broke.
  - R98 melted: it used to be a 20R0 1/8W resistor sitting between SHI(ACV) and SHI(DCV).
  - C49 has some flux residue and sits a bit askew, but not sure if replaced.
  - Fuses checked OK but worth to re-check, there's a bunch of them.
- Refdiv PCB
  - Some flux residue near isolation transformers, but could be just factory cleaning issue.
- Sine Source PCB
  - RL1-8 have been replaced, datecodes from 1994.
- AC PCB
  - F1 and F2 blown.
- I/Ohms
  - RL17, 24, 25 have been replaced, datecodes from 1995.
    RL17: Ohms ranges below 1M.
    RL24 & 25: Ohms output, LO and HI, respectively.
- Analog Interface PCB
  - Surprisingly dirty board, bunch of what looks like flux spots on the back. Nothing critical though.
- Digital PCB
  - C10 and surroundings appear to have been reworked.
  - Battery measures 3.69V.

Ejectors in general seem surprisingly discoloured and brittle, worse than either of my (much older) 4000s.

Curiously, most (all?) function boards had non-standard part numbers, e.g. DC board is 400861-1.0, which does not seem to match neither 4708 not 4808 manuals — they show 480536-4.0 and -4.4, respectively. PCB p/n and layouts do seem to match though.

Latest "original" datecodes are from 1990, firmware ROM is marked "26.11.90", so unit is likely to be late 1990/early 1991 production.

## Speculation, miscellania, and next steps

### ACV

<=100mV ACV ranges use a slightly different output path compared to higher ranges: they do not support remote sense and only output on `SHI`/`SLO` lines, which are not fused.

Given that

- <=100mV range output is derived from 1V range via passive attenuation (meaning 1V generation actually works);
- `F1` is on 1V range specifically;
- Rest of board does not show any signs of overload,

I suspect that blown fuses (and R98 on the DC board) are a result of external voltage applied to the terminals. I'll try replacing fuses (probably with something smaller than full 1A ones) and seeing how it goes.

100Hz range is murkier. It is different compared to other ranges in that it's the only one relying on `M11` on AC board for final frequency division; however, all frequencies use that IC, so scapegoating it is not easy. Sine Source PCB schematics hurts my head even more than rest of the boards, so this issue is not high on priorities list.

### DCV

Given that the only issue known so far is offset on low ranges, there's nothing much to do beyond capacitor replacement until performance verification is done.

### Ohms

Again, recap and performance verification.

Quick note: disabling remote sense (which is on by default in ohms mode) causes a very disconcerting rapid relay switching for a second or so. I first noticed it on a 4000, and was not sure if it's a fault or expected behaviour. Now that the same was observed on 4708, I can only assume it's an attempt to exercise relay contacts to try and keep contact resistance low — it's part of the spec in 2W mode.

### Current

According to manual, `FAIL 8` might be caused by analog logic `15V(2)` supply and not `38V(2)`. Given that it measured off and had a blown capacitor right on the PSU board, this is the primary suspect now. As mentioned above, PSU rail health signals seem to be ok.
